# Custom Marlin settings for my 3D Printer (Ender 3 Pro with v.4.2.7 motherboard)

This is a fork of the [Marlin project](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin), where I have just added the customizations that I needed for my printer (Creality Ender 3 Pro with v.4.2.7 motherboard).

It is based on version 2.0.9.1.

## Customizations
* Replacing Z-axis end stop with a BL-touch leveling sensor.
